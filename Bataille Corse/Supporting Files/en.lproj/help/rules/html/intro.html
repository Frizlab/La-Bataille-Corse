<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Bataille Corse is more a fast speed game than a deep reflexion game.
<br>But many variants involve the brains for simple yet very quick
deductions, making it a really addictive game.
</p>

Roughly speaking, each player plays a card in turn, and any player must
bang the pile of cards when certain patterns occur. The fastest wins the
pile.

<p>
The number of players may vary from 2 to 54, and all players play until
the end of the game, even when they have no card left.
