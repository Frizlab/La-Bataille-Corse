<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The reaction time of the computer</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The reaction time of the computer is randomly chosen between two bounds. These bounds are relative to <b>your</b> reaction time.</p>
<p>
You may for instance force the computer to play slower than you by setting the minimum reaction time to 0%, which means 'at least my reaction time'.
</p>
<p>
When several human players are playing, the mean of their calibrated reaction times is used.</p>
