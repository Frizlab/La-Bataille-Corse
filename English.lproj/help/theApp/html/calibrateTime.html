<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Reaction time calibration</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Warning : concentrate before you begin the calibration process !</p>
<p>Cards are put on the desk at a regular pace, but adapting to your previous reactions.
<br>
You must bang according to the rules of the game.</p>
<p>A wrong bang clears the pile, but is not taken into account: the top card flashes
to show the mistake.</p>
<p>The calibration terminates after 15 righteous bangs: it's a bit long, but proved necessary to obtain a significant value.</p>
<p>
You can stop the calibration process by closing the window.
