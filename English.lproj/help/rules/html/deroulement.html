<h3>How to play the game</h3>

<p>
Each player plays a card in turn, until a court card is played (Jolly, Queen, King or Ace)
or someone bangs.
<br>
The reasons to bang are detailed in <a href="whenHit.html" target="rframe">When to bang ?</a>
</p>
<h4>When a player bangs
</h4><ul>
<li>If he's right, he wins the pile.</li>
<li>If he's wrong, he puts a card beneath the pile (in certain variants: several cards, to be decided at the beginning of the game).</li>
</ul>

<h4>When a court card is played
</h4>
The <b>next</b> player must put a certain number of cards in a row:
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">One</span> for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jolly</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two</span> for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Queen</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Three</span> for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">King</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Four</span> for an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ace</span></li>
</ul>

<p>If a court card is put during this process, it is interrupted. The next player initiates an other one, and must put the number of cards corresponding to this last court card.
</p>
<p>
Bang conditions always take precedence, and also interrupt the process: when you have to bang, do it !
</p>
<p>If the player puts all the cards he had to without being interrupted, the pile goes to the player who played the court card.
</p>
<p>
When a player has no card left, the next player puts the card (or cards) he should have put.
</p>

<h3>The End of the Game</h3>
<p>The game is over when one of the players handles all 54 cards of the deck.
<br>This means that the game continues even if only one player still has some cards
in hand:&nbsp;he is alone to play the cards, but the other players are still allowed
to bang and win the pile.
</p>
<p>Good luck !</p>
