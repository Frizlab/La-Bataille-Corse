= The Egyptian Ratscrew
François Lamboley <francois.lamboley@frostland.fr>

This repository is an implementation of the “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Ratscrew[Egyptian Ratscrew]”
game I made when I was young. It is by no mean meant to be an exemplary implementation of the game, nor even a good
one. Nor will the game be fun to play! But it’s there 🙂

It has been to the latest Xcode version to date (Xcode 9.2) and should compile right out of the clone.
